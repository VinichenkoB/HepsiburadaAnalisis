### Summary:
Here I tried to answer the technical task where I had to analyze the work of the https://www.hepsiburada.com/ site according to the specified criteria.

### Task description:
On the Main page of https://www.hepsiburada.com/ you can see the different Recommendations section with different products. These sections are also shown on Product Detail and Cart pages. What are these product suggestions, what is the rule for listing these products and showing them to the user?
Full analysis is expected here.

### Analysis result:
The product suggestions that appear on the homepage, product detail pages, and cart pages of Hepsiburada.com are part of a personalized recommendation system. These recommendations are generated based on user behavior and past purchases, as well as the behavior of other similar users.

The recommendation system probably is powered by machine learning algorithms that analyze large amounts of data to understand user preferences and predict which products are most likely to be of interest to each individual user. It looks like the system uses various types of data, including clickstream data, purchase history, search queries, and browsing behavior, to build a comprehensive user profile.

Based on this user profile, the recommendation system generates personalized recommendations for each user. These recommendations can include products that the user has previously viewed, products that are frequently purchased by users with similar profiles, and products that are currently popular on the site.

The rule for listing these products and showing them to the user is based on relevance and personalization. The recommendation system is designed to show the most relevant products to each individual user based on their interests, preferences, and behavior. Most likely the system takes into account various factors, such as the popularity of the product, the user's past purchases, and browsing history.

In addition to the personalized recommendations, Hepsiburada.com also shows recommendations based on the user's current context. For example, on the cart page, the site may suggest complementary products or accessories for items already in the user's cart.

Overall, the personalized recommendation system used by Hepsiburada.com is designed to improve the user experience by making it easier for users to discover new products and find relevant items based on their interests and behavior.
